## Entity Relationship Model
- The Entity-Relationship (E-R) model helps design databases by defining the overall logical structure. It lays the foundation for logical data models by visually representing entities, their attributes, and relationships.

**Components**
1. Entity:A distinct object in the real world. 
![entity](/assets/unit2/entity.png)
2. Attributes: Properties which describe an entity. 
![attributes](/assets/unit2/attribute.png)
3. Relationship:A connection between entities.
![relation](/assets/unit2/relation.png)

**Overall Simple ERC**
![ERC](/assets/unit2/ERC.png)

**Primary Key**
1. Primary Key uniquely identifies each entity in an entity set.
2. Ensures no two entities have identical values for all attributes.
3. Can be a single attribute or a combination of multiple attributes.
4. Essential for maintaining data integrity and avoiding duplication.
5. It must be unique and not null in the table.
6. Represented in an ER model by underlining the attribute.

**Adding Attributes**

# Complex Attributes
1. Simple Attributes: Attributes are not divided into subparts.
![simple](/assets/unit2/simple.png)
2. Composite Attributes: Attributes can be divided into subparts.
![composite](/assets/unit2/composite.png)
3. Single-valued Attributes have only one value for a specific entity.
4. Single-valued Attributes hold a single value for each entity instance.
![mul](/assets/unit2/mul.png)
5. Derived Attributes are calculated from other attributes or entities.
![dervied](/assets/unit2/dervied.png)

## Types of Attributes
**Mapping Cardinalities**
- Mapping cardinalities define how many entities can be related to another entity.
- They describe the relationship ratio between entities.

1. **One-to-One Relationship**: Each entity in A is linked to at most one entity in B, and vice versa.
**Example:** In a COMPANY database, an employee has one spouse, and a spouse is linked to one employee.
![one_one](/assets/unit2/one_one.png)

2. **One-to-Many Relationship**: A single entity in A can be linked to multiple entities in B, but each entity in B is linked to only one entity in A.
**Example:** One department can have many employees, but each employee belongs to one department.
![one_many](/assets/unit2/one_many.png)

3. **Many-to-One Relationship**: Multiple entities in A can be linked to a single entity in B, but each entity in B is associated with only one entity in A.
**Example:** In a hospital, multiple surgeries are performed by one surgeon.
![many_one](/assets/unit2/many_one.png)

4. **Many-to-Many Relationship**: Multiple entities in A can be linked to multiple entities in B, and vice versa.
**Example:** An employee can work on multiple projects, and a project can have multiple employees. Similarly, a student can enroll in many classes, and each class can have many students.
![many_many](/assets/unit2/many_many.png)

## ERD notations

## Crow’s Foot Notation
![crow](/assets/unit2/crow.png)

## Four main types of membership relationships:
![membership](/assets/unit2/membership.png)

## Key
1. **Superkey:** A set of attributes that uniquely identifies an entity.
2. **Candidate Key:** A minimal superkey with no redundant attributes.
3. **Primary Key:** The chosen candidate key for unique identification.
4. **Secondary Key:** Used for data retrieval, e.g., Phone & Last Name.
5. **Alternate Key:** Candidate keys not selected as the primary key.
6. **Foreign Key (FK):** An attribute referencing a primary key in another table; it can be null and must match the data type of the primary key.
![key](/assets/unit2/key.png)

## Types of relationships
1. One to one
2. One to many
3. Many to many
4. Many to one
5. Ternary Relationships
6. Unary Relationship(Recursive)

1. **Ternary Relationships**
- A ternary relationship represents a many-to-many relationship among three entities.
- For n-ary relationships (n > 2), create a new table to represent the relationship.
- The primary key of this table is a combination of the primary keys of entities on the many side.
- In most n-ary cases, all participating entities have a many-side association.
![ternary](/assets/unit2/tenary.png)

2. **unary relationship**
- A unary relationship (also called recursive) occurs within the same entity set.
- t represents a relationship between different instances of the same entity.
- The primary key and foreign key are the same but represent entities with different roles.
![unary](/assets/unit2/uinary.png)

**Weak Entities**
- An entity type should have a key attribute to uniquely identify each entity.
- Some entity types lack a key attribute that can uniquely identify them.
![weak](/assets/unit2/weak.png)

**Homework**
Draw an entity relationship diagram for the student registration system at CST?
![homework](/assets/unit2/homework.jpg)

## Removing Redundant Attributes
- A good entity-relationship design does not contain
redundant attributes.
**Extended E-R Features**
1. **Specialization:**
- An entity set may have subgroups that are distinct from others within the set.
2. **Generalization:**
- A higher-level entity contains one or more lower-level entity sets in a hierarchical relationship.

## Attribute Inheritance
**Inheritance:**
- Attributes of the higher-level entity set are inherited by lower-level entity sets.
**Outcome of Specialization/Generalization:**
- A higher-level entity set with common attributes and relationships for all lower-level entities.
- Lower-level entity sets with unique attributes specific to each subgroup.

## Constraints on Specialisation/ Generalisation
1. **Membership constraints**
**Condition-Defined:**
- Membership is determined by a specific condition in the requirements.
- **Example:** A tanker is a ship where cargo = 'shoes'.
User-Defined Specialization/Generalization:
- The designer defines the superclass-subclass relationship.
Used to simplify the design model or represent complex entity relationships.

2. **Disjoint constraints**
- Applies when a superclass has multiple subclasses.
- An entity can belong to only one subclass at a time.
**Example:** A student can be either a postgrad or undergrad, but not both.
- Used to represent a disjoint superclass-subclass relationship.

**Overlapping:**
- Applies when a superclass has multiple subclasses.
- An entity can belong to only one subclass at a time.
**Example:** A student can be either a postgrad or undergrad, but not both.
- Used to represent a disjoint superclass-subclass relationship
![ovelapping](/assets/unit2/or.png)

## Completeness constraints
**Partial:**
- Some superclass entities may not belong to any subclass.
**Example:** Some people at UCT are neither students nor staff.
- The keyword {Optional} represents this type of relationship.
![partial](/assets/unit2/partial.png)

## Aggregation
**Limitation of E-R model:** Cannot express relationships among relationships.
![limit](/assets/unit2/limit.png)

**Aggregation**
- Aggregation is a concept that allows relationships to be treated as higher-level entities, providing an abstraction for complex relationships.
![aggregate](/assets/unit2/aggregate.png)

## Relational Model
1. **Structure:** Defines the relationships and content of the database.
2. **Integrity:** Ensures that the database adheres to specified constraints.
3. **Manipulation:** Provides a programming interface for interacting with and modifying the database's data.

## Relational Model Structure
- A relation is an unordered collection that includes the relationships of attributes representing entities.
- A tuple consists of a set of attribute values (also referred to as its domain) within the relation.
- The values are typically atomic or scalar.
- The special value NULL can be part of any domain, if permitted.

## Relational Database Terms
**Relation** - A Table
**Tuple** - Row of the table
**Attribute** - Column of the table.
**Database schema** - logical design
**Database instance**- snapshot of the database at a given instance of time.
![data](/assets/unit2/database.png)

## Relational Model:
**Primary Keys**
- The primary key of a relation uniquely identifies each tuple.
- Some DBMSs automatically generate an internal primary key if one is not explicitly defined for a table.
![primary key.png](/assets/unit2/primary_key.png)

- A relation's primary key uniquely identifies a single tuple (row) in a table.
- Some DBMSs automatically generate an internal primary key if one is not explicitly defined in the table.
![internal](/assets/unit2/internal.png)

**Foreign Keys**
- A foreign key ensures that an attribute in one relation corresponds to a specific tuple in another relation.
![foreign key](/assets/unit2/fk.png)

## Relational Model Keys
1. **Superkey:** A set of one or more attributes that uniquely identify a tuple in a relation.
**Example:** dep_id or a combination of dept_id & dept_name.
2. **Candidate Key:** An attribute or a combination of attributes that uniquely identify each tuple in a relation.
**Example:** CID in the student table, or a combination of student_name and student_id.
3. **Primary Key:** A candidate key selected by the database designer as the main identifier for tuples in a relation.
![relation](/assets/unit2/relation.png)

## Schema Diagrams
![schema](/assets/unit2/schema.png)

# ERD to Relational Schema
- The E-R model and the relational database model are both abstract, logical representations of real-world enterprises.
- Since both models follow similar design principles, an E-R design can be converted into a relational design.
![ERD](/assets/unit2/erd.png)

## Reducing E-R Diagrams to Relational Schemas
1. **Tables for Entities:**
- Each single-valued attribute becomes a table column.
- The entity’s primary key serves as the table’s primary key.

2. **Handling Special Attributes:**
- Multivalued attributes → Stored in a separate table.
- Composite attributes → Only sub-attributes become columns.
- Derived attributes → Not included in tables.

3. **Relationships as Tables:**
- Relationship sets are turned into tables.
- The table includes primary keys from related entities.
- Descriptive attributes of relationships are included.

4. **Primary Keys in Relationships:**
- Many-to-One / One-to-One → One entity's primary key is used.
- Many-to-Many → Combination of both entity primary keys.
- Foreign key constraints reference related entities

## When cardinality is concerned;
1. **Relationship (One-to-One)**
- Check whether participation is total or partial.
- If one entity has total participation, its primary key is used as a foreign key in the entity with partial participation.
- If participation is not specified or is the same for both, the designer can decide. In such cases, both entities may have each other's primary keys as foreign keys.

2. **1:N Relationship (One-to-Many or Many-to-One)**
- The primary key of the entity on the "one" side is used as a foreign key in the entity on the "many" side.

3. **M:N Relationship (Many-to-Many)**
- A new table is created to manage the relationship.
- The new table's primary key is a composite of two foreign keys from the related entities.
Unary Relationships (Self-Referencing)

4. **Unary 1:1**
**Three options exist:**
- Use the primary key of one entity as a foreign key in the other.
- Use the primary key of the second entity as a foreign key in the first.
- Use both entities' primary keys as foreign keys for each other.

5. **Unary 1:N**
- Use a recursive foreign key, referencing the primary key within the same table.

6. **Ternary Relationships**
- Three Entities Connected by a Relationship
- A new table is created.
- The primary key of this new table is composed of the primary keys of all participating entities.

## 3 methods
1. **1st Method**
- Each entity in the relationship is mapped to its own separate table.
- Student Table: Contains attributes (Regno, name)
- Posgrad Table: Contains attributes (Regno, supervisor)
- UnderGrad Table: Contains attributes (Regno, points)

2. **2nd Method**
- Only subclasses are mapped to tables, and the attributes of the superclass are duplicated in each subclass.
- Posgrad Table: Contains attributes (Regno, name, supervisor)
- UnderGrad Table: Contains attributes (Regno, name, points)
- This method is preferred when inheritance is disjoint and complete, meaning every student is either a PosGrad or an UnderGrad, but not both.

3. **3rd Method**
- Only the superclass is associated with a database table.
- Attributes from the subclasses are incorporated into the superclass.
- The Student table includes columns: Regno, name, supervisor, and points.
- This approach may lead to null values in certain cases:
- When an undergraduate student is added, the supervisor column will be null.
- When a postgraduate student is added, the points column will be null.

## Guidelines for Choosing Between Entities and Attributes
1. Attributes provide direct details about an entity.
2. Entities can have their own attributes and can form relationships with other entities.
3. If additional information may be needed about something, consider making it an entity rather than an attribute.
4. Relationships define interactions between entities.
5. Attributes can be converted into relationships if necessary.
**Extra:**
- Binary relationships are usually simpler to manage.
- N-ary relationships can be useful for modeling complex connections.
- N-ary relationships can be transformed into binary relationships by introducing new entities, but this may add complexity.

## Unified Modeling Language
- Entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are used to model the data representation aspect of a software system.
**Other key components of a system include:**
1. User interaction models (how users interact with the system).
2. Functional module specifications (defining system components and their interactions).
3. Unified Modeling Language (UML) is an industry-standard modeling language.
4. Developed by the Object Management Group (OMG), UML is used for designing and specifying different components of a software system.

**Key UML Diagram Types:**
1. Class Diagram – Represents the structure of a system with classes and their relationships.
2. Use Case Diagram – Shows how users interact with the system.
3. Activity Diagram – Illustrates workflows and process sequences.
4. Implementation Diagram – Describes the system's deployment and components.

## Relational Query Languages
- A query language allows users to retrieve information from a database.
**Types of Query Languages:**
1. Imperative Query Language – The user provides step-by-step instructions to retrieve data.
2. Functional Query Language – Queries are expressed as functions that operate on database data.
3. Declarative Query Language – The user specifies what data is needed without defining the exact steps to retrieve it.

## Relational Algebra
- Relational Algebra is a functional query language used to retrieve and manipulate data in relational databases.
- It serves as the theoretical foundation for relational databases and SQL.
**Unary Operations:**
- σ (Select) 
- π (Projection) 
**Binary Operation**
- ∩ Intersection
- – Difference
- ∪ Union
- × Product
- ⋈ Join
**Operands**
- ^ : AND
- v : OR
- ¬ : NOT
- > : Greater than
- < : Less than
- = : Equal to

 ## SELECT
- Chooses a subset of tuples from a relation that meet a specified condition.
- The predicate functions as a filter, keeping only the tuples that satisfy the condition.
- Multiple predicates can be combined using AND (conjunction) or OR (disjunction) to form more complex conditions.
- Syntax: σpredicate(R)
![select](/assets/unit2/select.png)

## PROJECTION
- Select and include only the specified attributes in the relation.
- Modify the order of attributes as needed.
- Exclude any unnecessary attributes.
- Transform existing values to generate new derived attributes.
- Syntax: ΠA1,A2,…,An(R)
![projection](/assets/unit2/projection.png)

## UNION
- Create a relation that includes all tuples from both input relations.
- Ensure that tuples appearing in either one or both relations are included.
- Use the UNION operation to combine the two relations.
- Syntax: (R ∪ S)
- Example: Student1 U Student2
 SQL Query( SELECT * FROM Student1 ) UNION
(SELECT * FROM Student2)
![union](/assets/unit2/union.png)

## INTERSECTION
- Construct a relation that includes only common tuples from both input relations.
- Ensure that only the tuples present in both relations are retained.
- Use the INTERSECT operation to find matching tuples.
- Syntax: (R n S) Student1 n Student2
- Result = SQL Query( SELECT * FROM Student1 )INTERSECT
(SELECT * FROM Student2)
![intersection](/assets/unit2/intersection.png)

## DIFFERENCE
- Create a relation that includes only tuples from the first input relation.
- Exclude any tuples that also exist in the second input relation.
- Use the EXCEPT (or MINUS) operation to filter out common tuples.
- Syntax: (R - S)
![differ](/assets/unit2/differe.png)

## Cartesian Product
- Create a relation containing all possible pairings of tuples from the input relations.
- Combine each tuple from the first relation with every tuple from the second relation.
- Use the Cartesian Product operation to generate the result.
- Syntax: (R X S)
- Result = SQL Query( SELECT * FROM Student CROSS JOIN
Department SELECT * FROM Student,Department;)
![cartesian](/assets/unit2/Cartesian.png)
![result](/assets/unit2/result.png)

## EXTRA OPERATORS
- Rename (ρ)
- Assignment (R←S)
- Duplicate Elimination (δ)
- Aggregation (γ)
- Sorting (τ)
- Division (R÷S)

## Relational Algebra NOTES 
- Relational algebra specifies the sequence of high-level operations for query execution.
- Example: Compare filtering before vs. after a join operation:
- Option 1: Apply selection after joining → σb_id=102(R ⋈ S)
- Option 2: Apply selection before joining → R ⋈ (σb_id=102(S))
- When dealing with large datasets, filtering first (Option 2) improves performance.
- Instead of specifying execution steps, it's better to define the desired outcome using a Declarative Query Language (e.g., SQL).

## Question
1. Consider the employee database Give an expression in relational
algebra to express each of the following queries:
*  Select all employees who live in the city “Miami”
* Find the name of each employee who lives in city “Miami”.
* Find the name of each employee whose salary is greater than
$100000.
* Find the name of each employee who lives in “Miami” and
whose salary is greater than $100000.
