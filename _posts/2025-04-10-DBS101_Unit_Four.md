# Overview
- In this unit it covers key SQL concepts like joins, views, transactions, and integrity constraints to manage and secure data effectively. It also explains data types, user-defined types, and auto-increment features to support consistent and efficient database design.

# Join Expressions
1. Natural Join:
- Performs a Cartesian product of the two tables.
- Keeps only the matching (consistent) rows.
- Removes duplicate columns from the result.
- Requires at least one common attribute (column) between the tables.

2. Inner Join: 
- Inner joins return only the rows with matching values in both tables. 
- Non-matching rows from either table are excluded.
- When a join is written without specifying "OUTER," it defaults to an inner join.

3. Outer Join:
- Outer joins are joins that return matched values and unmatched values from either or both tables. 
### LEFT JOIN: 
- includes all matched rows and unmatched rows from the left table
### RIGHT JOIN: 
- includes all matched rows and unmatched rows from the right table
### FULL OUTER JOIN:
includes all matched rows, along with unmatched rows from both tables

# View
- In SQL, a view is a virtual table created from a query result. It can pull data from one or more tables and present it in a simplified or customized way.

## Materialized Views
- Some database systems support materialized views, which are stored versions of views. These views are automatically updated when the underlying data changes. This update process is known as materialized view maintenance.

## Integrity Constraints
1. Entity Integrity Constraints
2. Domain Constraints
3. Referential Integrity Constraints
4. Key Constraints

## User Defined Types
1. Distinct types
2. structured data types

## Schemas Catalogs and Environments
## Database Structure:
- Modern databases use a hierarchical layout with catalogs, schemas, and tables.
## User Access:
- Users log in with credentials and are assigned default catalog and schema.
## Naming Format:
- Tables are named using catalog.schema.table, with defaults if parts are missing.
## Authorisation
- Authorisations on data include:
1. Authorisation to read data.
2. Authorisation to insert new data.
3. Authorisation to update data.
4. Authorisation to delete data.

## Authorisation on Roles: 
- A set of roles is created in the database.
## Authorisation on Views
- A user who creates a view does not necessarily receive all privileges on that view.
## Authorisation on Schemas
- The SQL standard specifies a primitive authorization mechanism for the database schema

## Transfer of privileges
- A user who has been granted some form of authorization may be allowed to pass on this authorization to other users.

## Dynamic SQL
- A general-purpose program can connect to and communicate with a database server using a collection of functions.
## Embedded SQL 
- Embedded SQL provides a means by which a program can interact with a database server.

## Functions and Procedures in SQL
- Functions and procedures are blocks of code designed to carry out specific tasks.
- In SQL, they help encapsulate business logic within the database itself, allowing complex operations to be executed consistently and efficiently.

# Triggers in SQL
- A trigger is a statement that the system executes automatically as a side effect of a modification to the database.
- Triggers are also useful mechanisms for alerting humans or for starting certain tasks automatically when certain conditions are met.
## When Not to Use Triggers
- During failover or replication — they may cause unexpected actions.
- If not carefully written — they can lead to errors or infinite loops.

## Recursion in SQL
- A recursive SQL Common Table Expression (CTE) is a query that repeatedly refers to its own output, continuing the process until no more results are returned.

## Restrictions on recursive query
- Recursive queries must be monotonic, meaning they should always produce results that grow or stay the same with each iteration.
- To ensure this, avoid the following in the recursive part of the query:
1. Aggregations on the recursive CTE.
2. NOT EXISTS conditions that reference the recursive CTE.
3. Set difference (EXCEPT) where the right-hand side uses the recursive CTE.

# What i have learned
## In this unit, I’ve gained a strong understanding of key SQL concepts essential for effective database management and design:
1. Join operations like natural, inner, and outer joins, and how they combine data from multiple tables.
2. The use of views and materialized views to present or store query results in a flexible and optimized manner.
3. The importance of integrity constraints (entity, domain, referential, key) to maintain valid and reliable data.
4. How to define user-defined types to create more meaningful and structured data models.
5. The structure of a database environment, including catalogs, schemas, and user access protocols.
6. Authorization mechanisms, including role-based access and privilege transfers, to control data security.
7. How to use embedded and dynamic SQL for integrating SQL with programming languages.
8. The role of functions and procedures in encapsulating business logic within the database.
9. How triggers automate database reactions to changes, and when to avoid using them.
10. Understanding recursive queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and their limitations.
