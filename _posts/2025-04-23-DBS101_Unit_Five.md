# Introduction
Database Systems Fundamentals refers to the core principles and concepts that form the foundation of database systems, which are essential for storing, retrieving, and managing data efficiently.

## Features of Good Relational Designs
1. Relation for every entity
- Each tuple should represent a single entity or relationship instance.
- Don’t mix attributes from different entities in one relation.
- Use only foreign keys to reference other entities.
- Keep entity and relationship attributes as separate as possible.

2. Lesser number of Null Values
- Design relations to minimize NULL values in tuples.
- Move frequently NULL attributes to separate tables with the same primary key.

3. No spurious tuples (Decomposition)
- Poor database design can cause incorrect results from JOINs.
- Ensure the lossless join property to get valid join outcomes.
- Design relations to prevent spurious tuples in natural joins.

## Decomposition 
- Decompose schemas to eliminate repeated information.
- Schemas with redundancy should be split into smaller, simpler ones.
### Key decomposition 
1. Lossless join (non-additive)
2. Dependency preservation
- Lossless join is essential and must be maintained.
- Dependency preservation is useful but not always required.

4. No redundancy
- Redundancy means storing the same data in multiple places.
- It leads to problems like extra storage, repeated data entry, and complex updates.
- If not handled properly, it can cause insertion, deletion, and update anomalies.

5. No modification anomaly
### Update anomaly 
- Update anomaly happens when the same data appears in multiple records, and only some are updated, causing inconsistencies.
- Example: Updating a customer’s address in one order but not others leads to mismatched data.
### Deletion anomaly 
- Deletion anomaly occurs when removing data about one entity accidentally deletes data about another.
- Example: Deleting a customer’s only order could also erase their details if stored only with the order.
### Insertion anomaly
- Insertion anomaly happens when you can't add data due to missing related information.
- Example: If an order ID is required to store customer details, you can't add a customer until they place an order.

## Normalisation Theory
- Normalization is a technique to reduce data redundancy and improve data retrieval.
- Approach: Decompose poorly designed schemas into proper normal forms, ensuring lossless decomposition.
### Notations:
- Lowercase → Schema (e.g., r)
- Uppercase → Relation (e.g., R1)
- K → Superkey: A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a relation.
- T → Tuple
#### Superkey condition:
- A set K is a superkey of r(R) if, in any valid instance of r, no two tuples have the same value for K (i.e., t1[k] ≠ t2[k]).

## Closure of Functional Dependencies:
- Armstrong's axioms define rules for dependencies: Reflexivity, Augmentation, Transitivity, Union, Decomposition, and Pseudotransitivity.
- Reflexivity: If α ⊆ β, then α → β.
- Augmentation: If α → β, then γα → γβ.
- Transitivity: If α → β and β → γ, then α → γ.
- Union: If α → β and α → γ, then α → βγ.
- Decomposition: If α → βγ, then α → β and α → γ.
- Pseudotransitivity: If α → β and γβ → δ, then αγ → δ.

## Closure of Attribute Sets Example:
- Given F = { A → B, B → C, A → D }, start with A⁺ = {A} and apply FDs:
- A → B: Add B → A⁺, now A⁺ = {A, B}.
- B → C: Add C → A⁺, now A⁺ = {A, B, C}.
- A → D: Add D → A⁺, now A⁺ = {A, B, C, D}.
- Thus, A⁺ = {A, B, C, D}.
- An attribute B is functionally determined by α if α → B.

## Canonical Cover
- An attribute is extraneous if removing it doesn’t change the closure of the dependencies. A canonical cover simplifies a set of functional dependencies F without losing meaning.
### Extraneous Attributes:
- Left-side removal: Attribute A is extraneous in α → β if removing A from α still implies α → β.
- Right-side removal: Attribute A is extraneous in β if removing A from β still implies α → β.
- A canonical cover Fc implies all dependencies in F and contains no extraneous attributes or duplicates.
### Dependency Preservation
- A decomposition of R into sub-relations R₁, R₂, ..., Rn is dependency preserving if the closure of preserved dependencies matches the closure of the original dependencies.

#### BCNF
- A relation R is in BCNF if for every functional dependency α → β, either:
- α → β is trivial (i.e., β ⊆ α).
- α is a superkey for R.
##### Decomposition Example:
- For in_dep(ID, name, salary, deptname, building, budget):
- (α ∪ β) = (deptname, building, budget)
- (R - (β - α)) = (ID, name, deptname, salary)

##### BCNF vs 3NF
- BCNF is stricter and preserves dependencies better.
- 3NF is more flexible, may reduce redundancy, but might lose dependencies.

##### Higher Normal Forms
- Higher normal forms address cases where functional dependencies alone can't prevent unnecessary data repetition.
##### Algorithms for Decomposition
- BCNF Decomposition: Check nontrivial dependencies for BCNF violations by computing closures.
- 3NF Decomposition: Uses a canonical cover of F to create new schemas and remove redundant ones.

## Multivalued Dependencies & 4NF
- BCNF doesn't remove all redundancy.
- If an instructor has multiple addresses and departments, address repeats.
- MVD X →→ Y means Y is independent when X is fixed.
- Example: ID →→ street, city
- 4NF: A relation is in 4NF if every non-trivial MVD has a superkey on the left.
- Fix: Decompose to avoid redundancy:
- r1(ID, name)
- r2(ID, street, city)

### Higher Normal Forms
- 5NF (PJNF): Removes redundancy from join dependencies.
- DKNF: Uses domain and key constraints.
- Rarely used due to complexity.
### Atomic Domains & 1NF
- 1NF requires all values to be atomic (indivisible).
- Avoid multi-valued or composite attributes.
##### Fix:
- phone_numbers → phone1, phone2
- address → street, city, state

## Database Design Process
### Schemas can originate from:
- E-R Diagrams – Good ones need little normalization.
- Single Schema – Broken into smaller ones via normalization.
- Ad-Hoc Design – Refined through testing and normalization.
- Normalization fixes poor E-R models and identifies issues using functional dependencies.

### Design Tips
- Use clear, consistent naming.
- Denormalize for performance if needed—at the cost of more maintenance.
### Temporal Data
- Valid over time (e.g., address with start/end dates).
### Schema:
- course(course_id, title, dept_name, credits, start_date, end_date)
- New data → new row with updated time.
- Use composite keys like (course_id, validperiod) to avoid overlap.
- SQL:2011 adds limited support (PERIOD FOR, temporal PK/FK).

# What I’ve Learned About Database Systems
## Fundamentals & Good Design Practices
- A well-structured relational database should have:
- A separate relation for each entity or relationship.
- Minimal null values.
- No spurious tuples from joins (ensure lossless decomposition).
- No redundancy, which helps avoid anomalies in update, insertion, or deletion.
- No modification anomalies—data changes shouldn't cause inconsistencies.

## Normalization Concepts
- Normalization helps reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- Decomposition should preserve dependencies and ensure a lossless join.
- Functional dependencies guide schema refinement.
- Canonical Cover helps simplify dependencies by removing unnecessary attributes.

## Normal Forms
- 1NF: All attributes must be atomic (no multi-valued or composite attributes).
- BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form): Every non-trivial functional dependency must have a superkey on the left.
- 3NF: A bit more flexible than BCNF, may retain some redundancy to preserve dependencies.
- 4NF: Deals with multivalued dependencies (e.g., multiple addresses or departments).
- 5NF (PJNF) and DKNF: Handle complex constraints but are rarely used due to difficulty.

## Functional Dependencies & Closure
- Armstrong’s Axioms are used to derive new functional dependencies.
- Closure helps identify all attributes functionally determined by a given set.

## Design Sources & Strategies
- Schema design can start from:
- E-R diagrams (preferred for structure)
- A single large schema (later normalized)
- Ad-hoc schemas (refined via testing)
## Emporal Data
- Time-based data needs start and end date columns.
- Functional dependencies may only hold at specific time snapshots.
