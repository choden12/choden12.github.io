## Reflection
- The second month of my internship at Tech Park Limited (TTPL) marked a major turning point as I transitioned from solely focusing on UI/UX design to actively developing real system components. This shift introduced me to the core of full-stack development and challenged me to apply technical concepts that I had only studied theoretically before. Month 2 was intense, engaging, and filled with practical learning moments that significantly strengthened my understanding of software development. Although our team reduced from four interns to two, this unexpected change pushed me to take on greater responsibilities and grow both technically and professionally.

## Knowledge, Skills, and Competencies Required
**As outlined by my mentor, the skills required for the development phase were more advanced than those needed during the UI/UX stage:**
## Technical Skills
- React (JavaScript): component-based architecture, JSX, hooks, state management, props, event handling.
- Node.js + Express (TypeScript): backend routing, controllers, middleware, type safety, async functions.
- API Development & Integration: sending and handling HTTP requests, validating data, structuring API endpoints.
- Database Setup: configuration of environment variables and connecting APIs to a database.
- Form Validation: both frontend validation and server-side validation for security.
- Version Control: branching, pushing, pulling, and maintaining project structure.

## Skills I Applied This Month
**Despite the increased workload, I applied several technical and personal skills throughout the month:**
- Frontend Development: I developed the entire Signup page interface using React and ensured its design aligned with the Figma prototype.
- Backend Development: I implemented API routes using Express (TypeScript), created controllers, and integrated validation.
- Full-stack Integration: I connected the Signup form to the backend so that new users could be saved properly.
- Debugging: Through tools like Postman and console logging, I tested API responses and resolved multiple issues.
- Database Configuration: I helped set up environment variables and basic database structures.
- Team Collaboration: Since only Yeshey and I were left, we divided tasks clearly and stayed aligned through regular discussions.

## Self-Assessment of My Current Proficiency
**Skill	Proficiency Level	Self-Reflection**
- React Frontend	Moderate	Comfortable with components but need to improve speed and structure.
- Node.js + Express	Beginner–Moderate	Still learning but gained confidence through backend setup.
- TypeScript	Beginner	Struggled with types but got better with practice.
- API Integration	Moderate	Successfully integrated Signup, but debugging took time.
- Time Management	Needs Improvement	Balancing multiple tasks was difficult at first.
- Problem-solving	Strong	Able to resolve errors through research and trial-and-error.

## Identified Gaps and Areas for Improvement
- Difficulty understanding TypeScript’s type system, interfaces, and strict typing.
- Struggled with designing clean folder structures for backend organization.
- Took more time than expected to debug backend logic.
- Limited experience with authentication (JWT, hashing passwords, secure login).
- Needed improvement in managing time and balancing tasks.
- Still learning React best practices like reusable components and optimization.

## Plan to Bridge These Gaps
- Complete beginner–intermediate TypeScript tutorials.
- Build small practice APIs using Node.js and Express.
- Practice React hooks more frequently.
- Learn error-handling techniques in backend development.
- Practice API integration with different components.
- Build a full CRUD project independently.
- Improve confidence in debugging through hands-on practice.

## Conclusion
- Month 2 was one of the most challenging yet rewarding stages of my internship. Switching from Figma design to actual coding felt like entering a new world. Every line of code required patience, understanding, and precision. The reduced team size initially felt overwhelming, but it also pushed me to take ownership of the project. Completing the Signup module—both frontend and backend—was a huge accomplishment because it was my first time building a complete feature from scratch.

- I learned the importance of breaking down tasks, staying consistent, and asking for help when needed. Moreover, this month helped me understand the full-stack workflow and appreciate how much effort goes into building even a single functional page.
