## Introduction
Welcome to Month 3 of my internship at Tech Park Limited (TTPL)!. This month has been an exciting and fulfilling experience as I became more comfortable working in a professional industrial environment. Each day felt more engaging and enjoyable as I adapted to the routine of an office-going professional.

After completing the Signup page in the previous month, I began working on the **Admin and Manager Dashboards** using the same technologies — **React (JavaScript)** for the frontend and **Node.js with Express (TypeScript)** for the backend. Since I had already gained significant experience from the Signup module, the process felt much smoother and more efficient this time.
By the end of the month, I successfully completed the **Admin Dashboard** for both the frontend and backend and also started developing the **Manager Dashboard (frontend)**.

## Highlights of the Month
- Completed the **Admin Dashboard** (frontend + backend) with key functionalities such as user management and project overview.  
- Designed the **Manager Dashboard frontend layout**, including navigation and placeholders for upcoming features.  
- Improved **API integration** between the frontend and backend for data fetching and updating.  
- Enhanced **UI consistency** by reusing common components from previous modules like Signup and Login.  
- Participated in code reviews and discussed **best practices** for React component design and Express routing.

## Learning Experience
- Gained deeper understanding of **React state management** and how to handle dynamic data in dashboards.  
- Learned how to create **secure backend endpoints** and connect them with the frontend efficiently.  
- Strengthened my knowledge of **API design**, particularly in structuring routes for different roles (Admin, Manager, Developer).  
- Improved my ability to **debug and test** both frontend and backend components simultaneously.  
- Understood the importance of **UI consistency** and reusability of components across multiple pages.  
- Enhanced time management and prioritization skills by balancing multiple modules in parallel.

## Industry Insights
- Realized that professional software projects require **modular development**, where each component (Admin, Manager, etc.) can be independently developed and later integrated.  
- Understood the importance of **maintaining clean, reusable code** for scalability and long-term maintenance.  
- Observed that proper **API documentation** and consistent naming conventions are vital for team collaboration.  
- Learned that **communication and regular updates** with mentors or team leads are crucial for maintaining progress and alignment.

## Challenges Faced
- Encountered difficulties in implementing **data synchronization** between frontend and backend when fetching multiple datasets for dashboards.  
- Faced some **UI layout issues** while designing the Manager Dashboard, especially when integrating dynamic elements.  
- Managing **backend logic and authentication** for role-based access required extra time and research.  
- Balancing time between learning and implementation was challenging, especially while switching between modules.

## Next Month’s Plan
- Complete the remaining **Manager Dashboard backend integration**.  
- Implement the **Forgot Password** feature with secure email-based reset functionality.  
- Test the full workflow between **Signup, Login, Admin, and Manager** modules.  
- Optimize existing code for better performance and maintainability.  
- Prepare for **final integration and system testing** across all modules.

## Conclusion
Month 3 marked a significant step forward in my internship journey as I transitioned from building individual components to developing fully functional dashboards. Completing the Admin Dashboard and beginning the Manager module gave me a stronger grasp of how complex systems are structured and managed. I also learned the importance of modularity, collaboration, and consistent coding practices. In the upcoming month, I aim to finalize the remaining modules, ensuring that the Project Management System is ready for full integration and testing.
