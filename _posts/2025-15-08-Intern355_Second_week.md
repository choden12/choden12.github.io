## Introduction
- Welcome to Week 2 of my internship at TTPL! It has been another productive and engaging week working alongside experienced and supportive colleagues. This week, our team successfully completed the prototype for both the phone and desktop views of the Project Management System, which was approved by the client. Alongside this, I also worked on the proposal for my upcoming capstone project, which I will be developing in my third semester.

## Highlights
- Revisited concepts we missed in Week 1, such as refining the Figma design and clearly defining different positions for different roles in the system.
- Updated the text box feature to support a drag-and-drop function for better usability.
- Revised the color scheme and icons to give the website a more professional and formal appearance.
- Presented the updated UI design to my mentor and implemented improvements based on his feedback.

## Learning Experience
- Developed a deeper understanding of the importance of color combinations in creating a visually appealing and user-friendly UI.
- Learned that before starting coding, it’s important to plan the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to ensure a clear database structure.

## Industry Insights
- By the end of this week, I realized that creating a user-friendly prototype design is one of the most critical steps in any project. A well-structured prototype serves as a blueprint for all further development, ensuring that every team member is aligned with the project’s vision and objectives.

## Challenges
- Initially felt confused about the main concept and wasn’t sure where to start with UI designing, but overcame this by discussing ideas with my mentor and team.

## Next Week’s Plan
- Begin working on both the frontend and backend development of the Project Management System.
- Learn how to set up and use GitHub effectively for version control and project collaboration.
