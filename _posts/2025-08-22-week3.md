## Introduction
- Welcome to the third week of my internship with Sangay. This week was quite an unusual experience as I adapted more to a formal industrial environment. It was both funny and enjoyable playing the role of an office-going professional.

- It’s almost a month now and we are still working on Figma. Honestly, I thought designing on Figma would be easy to complete within a week, but I cannot imagine we are still not done. The main reason was that our earlier designs were not up to the mark and missed several requirements. Because of this, we had to **redesign the entire UI from scratch**. This time, we made sure to carefully fulfill every requirement for the Project Management System.  

## Highlights
- Completely **redesigned the UI** of the Project Management System because the previous version was a mess.  
- Added new features such as a **homepage, finance report, and finance personal profile**.  
- Implemented a **common login and signup system** for all role holders (Admin, Manager, Finance, Developer).  
- Improved navigation by adding a **dropdown feature** for better user experience.  

## Project's Architecture

## Learning Experience
- Learned that **redesigning is a natural part of the development cycle** and sometimes starting fresh is the best way to meet requirements.  
- Understood the importance of **progress tracking and proper management** to avoid repeating the same mistakes.  
- Gained a deeper appreciation for how crucial **color combinations, layout balance, and visual hierarchy** are in creating a user-friendly UI.  
- Realized that **attention to detail** and careful review are necessary before presenting work to a mentor.  
- Learned that **UI design is not just about looks** but also about functionality, workflow, and meeting end-user requirements.  

## Industry Insights
- Realized that in industry, designs often need to go through several iterations before they meet expectations.  
- Understood that **time management** is critical, as delays in design can affect the overall project timeline.  
- Learned that teamwork and communication are essential when redesigning, since multiple opinions and corrections need to be integrated.  

## Challenges
- The biggest challenge was **redoing the entire UI** after realizing the last version was messed up and not fulfilling requirements.  
- Coordinating changes across multiple roles (Admin, Finance, Manager, Developer) was time-consuming and required constant feedback sessions.  
- Struggled with maintaining consistency in color schemes, layouts, and icons while adding new features.  
- Managing motivation was difficult, since it was discouraging to start over, but teamwork helped us push through.  

## Next Week’s Plan
- Get final mentor approval for the **newly redesigned UI** and make any last corrections if required.  
- Start preparing for the **development phase** by converting the approved design into functional components.  
- Learn about **frontend frameworks** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) to begin coding the system.  
- Explore **database connectivity** and finalize the ERD to ensure smooth integration with the backend.  
- Set up a **GitHub repository** for version control and collaboration.
