## Introduction
- Welcome to Week 2 of my internship at TTPL! It has been another productive and engaging week working alongside experienced and supportive colleagues. This week, our team successfully completed the prototype for both the phone and desktop views of the Project Management System, which was later reviewed and approved by the client. This milestone boosted my confidence as I could see how our combined efforts were shaping into something meaningful. Alongside this achievement, I also spent time working on the proposal for my upcoming capstone project, which I will be developing during my third semester. Preparing the proposal allowed me to align my academic work with my internship experience, ensuring that the skills I am gaining now will directly contribute to my future projects.

## Highlights
- Revisited and addressed the concepts that we missed in Week 1, such as refining the Figma design and ensuring that different positions in the system have clearly defined roles and responsibilities. This made the workflow more structured and realistic.  
- Updated the text box feature by integrating a drag-and-drop function, making the user interface more interactive and convenient to use.  
- Revised the overall color scheme and icon set of the website to create a professional, modern, and formal look, which significantly improved the overall user experience.  
- Presented the updated prototype and UI design to my mentor, after which I received valuable feedback. Based on his suggestions, I made adjustments to enhance clarity, visual consistency, and prototype across the system.  

## Project's Architecture
The Project Management System has been designed with multiple modules, each tailored to specific roles within the organization. These include:  
1. **Admin** – Handles overall system management and user privileges.

2. **Developer** – Focused on task assignments, progress tracking, and collaboration tools.

3. **Finance** – Designed to manage budgeting, project expenses, and resource allocation.

4. **Manager** – Supports project supervision, team coordination, and decision-making activities.

- This architecture ensures that each user type interacts with the system in a way that directly supports their responsibilities, making the platform both role-specific and efficient.

## Learning Experience
- I gained a deeper understanding of how crucial **color combinations** and visual hierarchy are in creating a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing UI. Even small changes in design can greatly influence how users interact with a system.  
- I also learned the importance of **planning the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** before starting the coding phase. Having a clear ERD helps avoid confusion later in the development process by ensuring that the database structure is logical, scalable, and easy to maintain.  
- Additionally, I improved my communication skills by learning to discuss challenges openly with my mentor and teammates, which helped me overcome design-related doubts more efficiently.  

## Industry Insights
- By the end of this week, I realized that creating a **well-structured and user-friendly prototype** is one of the most important steps in any project. A prototype is not just a design draft—it acts as a **blueprint for development**, aligning every team member with the same vision and objectives.   

## Challenges
- At first, I felt confused about the main concept of the project and wasn’t sure where to begin with UI designing. It was overwhelming to balance functionality with appearance. However, by discussing ideas with my mentor and collaborating with the team, I was able to break down the problem into smaller tasks, making the process much easier.  
- Another challenge was learning to think from the perspective of different users (admin, manager, developer, finance), which required me to broaden my understanding of how roles interact within an organization.  

## Next Week’s Plan
- Need to change UI of the projects,
- Begin working on both the **frontend and backend development** of the Project Management System, translating the approved prototype into a functional application.  
- Learn how to **set up and use GitHub effectively** for version control and collaboration. This includes creating repositories, committing code, branching, merging, and working on pull requests to streamline teamwork.  
- Study basic database connectivity to ensure smooth communication between the backend and the database.  
- Gain more hands-on experience with project collaboration tools, which will help me adapt to real-world software development workflows.
