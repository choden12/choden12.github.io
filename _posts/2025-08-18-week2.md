## Introduction
- Welcome to Week 2 of my internship at TTPL! It has been another productive and engaging week working alongside experienced and supportive colleagues. This week, our team successfully completed the prototype for both the phone and desktop views of the Project Management System, which was later reviewed by our mentor. Although he appreciated our efforts, he pointed out that the design was still not fully up to expectations and that we had missed some important points. This feedback was a reminder that even when a design looks polished, there is always room for refinement and improvement. Alongside this, I also spent time working on the proposal for my upcoming capstone project, which I will be developing during my third semester. Preparing the proposal allowed me to align my academic work with my internship experience, ensuring that the skills I am gaining now will directly contribute to my future projects.

## Highlights
- Revisited and addressed the concepts that we missed in Week 1, such as refining the Figma design and ensuring that different positions in the system have clearly defined roles and responsibilities.  
- Updated the text box feature by integrating a drag-and-drop function, making the user interface more interactive and convenient to use.  
- Revised the overall color scheme and icon set of the website to create a professional, modern, and formal look, which significantly improved the overall user experience.  
- Presented the updated prototype and UI design to my mentor. While she acknowledged the progress, she pointed out missing details and areas that still required refinement to better align with the project’s objectives.  

## Project's Architecture
The Project Management System has been designed with multiple modules, each tailored to specific roles within the organization. These include:  
1. **Admin** – Handles overall system management and user privileges.

2. **Developer** – Focused on task assignments, progress tracking, and collaboration tools.

3. **Finance** – Designed to manage budgeting, project expenses, and resource allocation.

4. **Manager** – Supports project supervision, team coordination, and decision-making activities.

- This architecture ensures that each user type interacts with the system in a way that directly supports their responsibilities, making the platform both role-specific and efficient.

## Learning Experience
- I gained a deeper understanding of how crucial **color combinations** and visual hierarchy are in creating a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing UI. Even small changes in design can greatly influence how users interact with a system.  
- I also learned the importance of **planning the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** before starting the coding phase. Having a clear ERD helps avoid confusion later in the development process by ensuring that the database structure is logical, scalable, and easy to maintain.  
- I realized that receiving **constructive criticism from a mentor** is an important part of growth. While it can feel discouraging, it pushes us to pay closer attention to detail and strive for higher standards.  
- Additionally, I improved my communication skills by learning to discuss challenges openly with my mentor and teammates, which helped me overcome design-related doubts more efficiently.  

## Industry Insights
- By the end of this week, I realized that creating a **well-structured and user-friendly prototype** is one of the most important steps in any project. A prototype is not just a design draft—it acts as a **blueprint for development**, aligning every team member with the same vision and objectives.  
- Feedback and review cycles are essential to ensure that the design meets professional standards and user expectations.  

## Challenges
- At first, I felt confused about the main concept of the project and wasn’t sure where to begin with UI designing. It was overwhelming to balance functionality with appearance. However, by discussing ideas with my mentor and collaborating with the team, I was able to break down the problem into smaller tasks, making the process much easier.  
- Another challenge was learning to think from the perspective of different users (admin, manager, developer, finance), which required me to broaden my understanding of how roles interact within an organization.  
- Despite our improvements, we still missed out on several important points in the design, which led to our mentor’s feedback that the prototype was not fully up to the mark.  

## Next Week’s Plan
- Redesign the **UI of the Project Management System** to address all the points highlighted by our mentor.  
- Ensure that the revised design fully meets the requirements and expectations, both in functionality and professional standards.  
- Begin preparing the prototype for transition into development once the mentor approves the updated version.  
- Continue refining our teamwork and communication to avoid missing critical details in future project phases.
