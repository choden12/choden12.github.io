## Introduction
Everything has come to an end, and this marks the final month of my internship journey at **Tech Park Limited (TTPL). It has been a rewarding and memorable experience, allowing me to grow both technically and professionally.  

During this final phase, I completed the Manager Dashboard (frontend)and partially worked on the backend. However, our mentor advised us not to continue with full backend development for other modules, so we focused mainly on finalizing and refining the frontend components.I had used same technologies — **React (JavaScript)** for the frontend and **Node.js with Express (TypeScript)** for backend function  

Additionally, I successfully completed the Forgot Password module. After completing all my assigned tasks, I merged my components into the main project branch, preparing the system for final review and presentation.

## Challenges Faced
- Managing the **final integration and branch merging** process required careful attention to prevent overwriting or code conflicts.  
- Adjusting to the change in project scope (stopping backend work for certain modules) was initially confusing.  
- Encountered some issues with **responsive layout** while finalizing the dashboard UI.  
- Handling **time constraints** while completing the last few modules and preparing for project submission was challenging.

## Conclusion
Month 4 marked the **completion of my internship journey** at Tech Park Limited. From the first design sketches in Figma to building functional components using React and Node.js, this internship has been an incredible learning experience. I not only improved my technical skills but also gained valuable insights into teamwork, professionalism, and project management.  

As I conclude my internship, I feel proud of the progress made—from learning how to design and code a real-world system to collaborating effectively within a professional environment. This journey has truly prepared me for future opportunities in the software development field.
