## Introduction
Hello, I am Sangay Choden, currently working as a Software Developer Intern at Tech Park Limited (TTPL).My internship runs from August 4th to August 30th, 2025, and our team consists of four interns—two from the College of Science and Technology (CST) and two from India.  

Under the guidance of our team lead, we were assigned to develop a Project Management System for the company to efficiently track ongoing projects. Throughout the first month, our main focus was on the UI/UX design phase using Figma, gradually improving the prototype based on mentor feedback and real-world design expectations.

## Highlights of the Month
### Week 1 – Initial Design Phase
- Designed the **initial UI** for both desktop and mobile using Figma.  
- Learned teamwork, task distribution, and constructive feedback handling.  
- Faced rejection of our first design due to not meeting professional standards.  
- Understood the need for aligning designs with organizational goals.  

**Initial Designs:**

### Week 2 – Redesign & Improvement
- Revised the Figma prototype to ensure clear roles for each user (Admin, Developer, Manager, Finance).  
- Added drag-and-drop features, improved the color scheme, and refined icons.  
- Mentor acknowledged our progress but advised further refinement.  
- Learned about Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) and their role in database planning.

## Conclusion
The first month of my internship at Tech Park Limited has been a valuable journey of learning, adaptation, and growth. Despite facing challenges and rejections, each experience helped strengthen my technical and professional abilities. By the end of this month, our team successfully transformed our understanding of design from basic sketches to a refined, industry-standard prototype — ready to transition into development in the coming weeks.
