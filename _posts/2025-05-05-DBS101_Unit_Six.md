# Introduction
Indexes are special data structures (often lookup tables) that a database uses to speed up the retrieval of records. Instead of scanning the entire table to find matching rows, the database search engine uses indexes to quickly locate the data. This greatly improves query performance, especially on large datasets.

## Types of indices
# Ordered Indices:
- Store values in sorted order; efficient for range and binary searches.

## types of ordered indexing:
1. Clustering Index/Primary Index
- Records are stored in the same order as the index.
- Each entry has a search key and a pointer to the first matching record.
- The search key is often (but not always) the primary key.

2. Non-clustering Index/Secondary Index
- Records are not stored in the same order as the index.
- Each entry has a search key and pointers to all matching records.

- An index entry has a search key and pointers to matching records.
- A pointer includes the disk block ID and offset to locate the record.

## Types of Ordered Indices:
1. Dense Index: 
- Entry for every search key value.
- Clustering: Points to the first record with that key.
- Non-Clustering: Points to all records with that key.
2. Sparse Index: 
- Entry for only some search key values.
- Works only if data is sorted by the search key (clustering index).
- Each entry points to the first record with that key.

# Hashed Indices:
- Use a hash function to assign values to buckets; best for exact match queries.
## Search Key:
- An attribute or set of attributes used to look up records.

# Multilevel Indices
- An outer index on top of the main (inner) index.
- Inner index: Stored on disk.
- Outer index: Smaller, fits in memory for faster access.

## Searching with Multilevel Index:
- Binary search the in-memory outer index to find the range.
- Read and search only the relevant part of the inner index from disk.
### Usefulness:
- Great for large indexes that don’t fit in memory—speeds up searches by minimizing disk reads.
