- The final phase of my internship, covering Month 3 and Month 4, allowed me to dive deeper into dashboard development and project integration. By this time, I had become more comfortable working in a professional environment, understood the development workflow more clearly, and felt more confident in my abilities. These two months involved completing the Admin Dashboard, building the Manager Dashboard, implementing the Forgot Password feature, and merging all final work into the main project branch.

## Knowledge, Skills, and Competencies Required
**The responsibilities in this phase demanded a more advanced skill set:**
## Technical Competencies
- React Dashboard Development: developing pages, sidebar navigation, routing, and dynamic data handling.
- Backend Integration: connecting dashboards to backend APIs for real-time interaction.
- Role-Based Access: ensuring Admin and Manager dashboards are separated properly.
- Git and Version Control: merging branches, resolving conflicts, pushing final updates.
- Frontend Optimization: improving UI consistency, responsiveness, and performance.
- Basic Deployment Concepts: preparing code for handover and potential deployment stages.

### Professional Competencies
- Time management and prioritizing tasks
- Clear communication during reviews
- Adapting to sudden changes (such as reduced backend scope)
- Collaboration and maintaining project consistency
- Attention to detail in final polishing

## Skills I Applied During Month 3–4
**Throughout these months, I applied:**
- React Development: I built the Admin Dashboard (frontend + backend), including user management and project overview pages.
- Manager Dashboard: I created the full frontend layout and navigation.
- Forgot Password Module: Implemented the UI and backend logic for resetting passwords.
- API Integration: Connected UI components to backend endpoints for data fetching.
- Git Workflow: Merged my work into the main branch and resolved conflicts properly.
- UI Refinements: Improved spacing, layout consistency, responsiveness, and user experience.
- Communication: Participated in mentor meetings, code reviews, and design discussions.

## Self-Assessment of My Current Proficiency
- React Dashboard Development	Strong	Comfortable building reusable layouts and components.
- Backend API Development	Moderate	Improved routing and structure but still learning advanced concepts.
- Role-Based Access Logic	Moderate	Need deeper understanding, but implemented basic flows successfully.
- Version Control (Git)	Strong	Successfully handled merge conflicts and main branch updates.
- UI Responsiveness	Moderate	Improved but still need more practice with grid and flex layouts.
- Debugging Across Full Stack	Moderate	Able to debug, but it sometimes took longer than expected.

## Identified Gaps
- Need stronger understanding of authentication workflow.
- Sometimes struggled with responsive dashboard layouts.
- Backend scalability and advanced logic still require improvement.
- Need practice writing cleaner, more maintainable code.
- Require more experience handling complex API integration.

## Plan to Improve These Areas
- Learn JWT-based authentication and secure login systems.
- Practice building dashboard layouts with Material UI or Tailwind.
- Review tutorials on responsive design and layout grids.
- Build a personal full-stack project with full authentication.
- Learn state management tools like Redux or React Query.
- Study backend architecture patterns to improve API design.

## Conclusion
- The last two months were the most productive and meaningful part of my internship journey. By completing full modules like the Admin Dashboard and Forgot Password feature, I gained confidence in my ability to build real-world software. I also learned the importance of writing clean code, staying organized, and testing every feature thoroughly before merging.

- One of the biggest learning moments was handling merge conflicts and integrating my work into the main branch. This experience taught me the importance of communication, patience, and careful coordination in a team environment. Another important takeaway was understanding that projects sometimes require scope adjustments; when our mentor advised us not to continue implementing the full backend for all modules, it taught me adaptability and prioritization.

- Overall, Month 3 and Month 4 helped me transition from a beginner to a more confident developer. I learned how dashboards function, how frontend and backend communicate, how to maintain code quality, and how professionals collaborate in a real software company. Completing this internship has truly strengthened my technical foundation and prepared me for future full-time opportunities.
