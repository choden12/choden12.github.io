## Introduction
#### Week 1 (04/08/2025 - 11/08/2025)
- Hello, I am Sangay Choden, currently working as a Software Developer intern at Tech Park Limited (TTPL). This internship runs from August 4th to August 8th, 2025. Our team consists of four interns two from the College of Science and Technology (CST) and two from India.

- Under the guidance of our team lead, I, along with my colleagues Yeshey, Phurpa, and Dilliram, have been assigned to develop a Project Management System for the company. The goal of this system is to efficiently track the progress of ongoing projects. During this first week, we focused on designing the project structure and user interface using Figma. Although we completed the design phase on schedule, our mentor rejected the work as it did not meet the required standards and expectations. This feedback highlighted the need for us to rethink our approach and align our work more closely with professional requirements.

## Learning Experience
- Learned how to collaborate effectively within a team, including task distribution, communication, and feedback sharing.
- Gained practical experience using Figma for UI/UX design, though also realized the importance of meeting professional standards in design.
- Developed resilience in handling constructive criticism from mentors and learned that rejection is part of the professional growth process.
- Improved problem-solving and design thinking skills by discussing how to overcome weaknesses in our first design.
- Understood the value of adaptability when faced with unexpected setbacks such as rejection.

## Industry Insights
- Realized that modern software development requires proficiency not only in coding but also in design tools like Figma to build user-friendly applications.
- Understood that feedback and rejection are an integral part of the development cycle, ensuring better outcomes in the long run.
- Learned that structured processes and critical reviews help to improve overall project quality.
- Noticed that Tech Park places strong emphasis on preparing interns to face real-world industry challenges, including setbacks and revisions.

## Challenges
- Receiving rejection from our mentor was a major challenge, as it required us to confront the shortcomings in our design work.
- Adjusting to working in a team with members from different backgrounds and skill levels posed difficulties in achieving a unified design approach.
- Managing schedules alongside internship tasks required careful planning, especially when faced with unexpected rework.
- Ensuring the design could meet both desktop and mobile requirements involved multiple rounds of discussion and revisions, yet still fell short in this round.

## Next week's plan
1. Reflect on Mentor’s Feedback  
- Analyze the reasons for the rejection and discuss what could have been done differently.  
- Document lessons learned for future reference.  

2. Decision on Continuation or Resignation  
- As a team, evaluate whether to redesign the system according to the mentor’s expectations or to resign from the project if alignment cannot be achieved.  
- If resigning, prepare a formal resignation letter explaining the reasons, experiences gained, and lessons learned during the internship.  

3. Professional Closure  
- Ensure smooth handover of all files and documentation created during Week 1.  
- Maintain professionalism by leaving the internship on a respectful and positive note, regardless of the decision.
