## Reflection
- My internship at Tech Park Limited (TTPL) began with a strong emphasis on understanding the foundation of software development through UI/UX design. During these first four weeks, I worked as part of a four-member intern team to develop a Project Management System for the company. Under the guidance of our mentor, our main responsibility for the first month was to design a user-friendly, visually consistent, and professionally aligned Figma prototype that matched the company’s requirements.

## Required Knowledge, Skills, and Competencies
- According to our supervisor, the skills required for this phase included:
### UI/UX Design Fundamentals
- Understanding layout, color theory, design hierarchies, spacing, alignment, and visual consistency.
### Figma Prototyping Skills
- Ability to create wireframes, interactive prototypes, components, and reusable styles.
### Team Collaboration Skills
- Task distribution, communication, receiving feedback, and maintaining team harmony.
### Understanding User Roles & System Architecture
- Designing tailored interfaces for Admin, Manager, Developer, and Finance modules.
### Problem-Solving and Iteration Skills
- Ability to revise designs based on feedback and improve them to match industry requirements.

## Skills I Applied
**Throughout the month, I consistently applied:**
- Figma skills to design desktop and mobile views.
- Team collaboration, especially when redesigning layouts with my peers.
- Critical thinking, especially after our first design was rejected.
- Adaptability, learning to restructure and redesign everything from scratch.
- System understanding, mapping user roles and functionalities before designing screens.

## Self-Assessment of Current Proficiency
- Skill / Competency	Current Proficiency	Reflection
- UI/UX Design	Moderate	I understood basics but struggled with maintaining professional standards initially.
- Figma Prototyping	Moderate to Strong	Improved significantly after multiple redesigns and mentor feedback.
- Teamwork	Strong	I collaborated well, shared ideas, and contributed actively.
Understanding User Flows	Moderate	Learning to design based on user roles was new, but I adapted well.
- Receiving Feedback	Strong	Learned to embrace criticism and grow from it.
Design Consistency	Moderate	Needed improvement to ensure uniform spacing, colors, and layout alignment.

## Gaps Identified
- Difficulty maintaining a consistent layout across multiple screens.
- Limited experience designing enterprise-level dashboards.
- Lack of deep understanding of design heuristics (contrast, hierarchy, and alignment).
- Initial struggle balancing aesthetics with functionality.
- Need to improve efficiency in Figma through auto-layout and components.

5. Plan to Bridge the Gaps
**To improve myself, I will:**
### Short-Term (Next 2–4 Weeks)
- Take beginner-to-intermediate UI/UX courses (YouTube, Coursera, or Figma Academy).
- Practice auto-layout, component creation, and reusable styles in Figma.
- Analyze professional dashboards and replicate them for practice.
- Request mentor feedback more frequently to refine design skills.

## Conclusion 
- The first month taught me that design is not simply about creativity but about precision, clarity, and user-oriented thinking. The rejection of our initial design became an important turning point. It taught me resilience, patience, and the value of continuous refinement. Overall, this phase strengthened my technical foundation and made me more confident as I prepared to move into development next month.
