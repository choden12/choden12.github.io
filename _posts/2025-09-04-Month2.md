## Introduction
Welcome to Month 2 of my internship at Tech Park Limited (TTPL)!. This month has been another productive and engaging experience, allowing me to dive deeper into the development and implementation phase of the Project Management System. Our team successfully completed the prototype for the desktop views, which was reviewed and approved by our mentor.  

After completing the design phase, we officially began the implementation stageof the project. Unfortunately, two of our team members left the internship, leaving only Yeshey and me to complete the remaining work. Despite this challenge, we remained committed and divided the tasks strategically:
- **My Tasks:** Manager, Admin, Signup, and Forgot Password components  
- **Yeshey’s Tasks:** Finance, Developer, Login, and Logout components  

For development, we used React with JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express (TypeScript)** for the backend. This month, I focused mainly on the Signup page—both its frontend and backend integration. It took considerable time and effort since it was our first experience building a full system from scratch, but it provided a great opportunity to learn real-world application development.

## Highlights of the Month
- Officially transitioned from designing to coding and implementation.  
- Successfully completed the Signup Page (Frontend + Backend) with proper validation and connection to the server.  
- Set up the project structure in React and Node.js, including API routes, controllers, and server configuration.  
- Configured the database connection and environment setup for backend development.  
- Collaborated with Yeshey to maintain a consistent design and functionality across all modules.  
- Gained experience using TypeScript for backend type safety and improved error handling.

## Learning Experience
- Learned how to set up a full-stack project using React, Node.js, and Express.  
- Gained practical experience in frontend-backend integration, including handling requests and responses via APIs.  
- Understood the importance of modular coding , separating frontend logic, backend routes, and database layers.  
- Learned how to debug and test endpoints using tools like Postman.  
- Improved understanding of asynchronous programming and how to handle promises effectively in JavaScript.  
- Developed stronger problem-solving skills by facing and resolving real implementation issues.  
- Enhanced teamwork and communication skills while managing a smaller team.

## Industry Insights
- Realized that software development is not just about writing code—it requires planning, testing, and continuous improvement.  
- Understood that project scalability and code organization are crucial for long-term maintenance.  
- Experienced how team restructuring and member loss can affect workflow, but proper task distribution and communication can keep the project on track.  
- Learned that using TypeScript adds reliability to backend development by reducing runtime errors.  
- Observed how industry projects require a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies for successful deployment.

## Challenges Faced
- Adjusting to the reduced team size was initially difficult, as we had to handle double the workload.  
- Setting up the backend server and connecting APIs to the frontend was challenging, especially while learning new frameworks simultaneously.  
- Encountered multiple bugs and syntax errors in both React and TypeScript during integration.  
- Faced time management issues as development took longer than expected, particularly for the Signup component.  
- Understanding authentication and data flow between frontend and backend required several attempts and debugging sessions.

## Next Month’s Plan
- Begin working on frontend and backend for both Manager Dashboard and admindashboard. 
- Integrate functionalities such as project creation, task assignment, and progress tracking for the manager and admin  module.  
- Ensure the dashboard design aligns with the approved Figma prototype.  
- Implement authentication and authorization features for secure user access.  
- Test the Signup, Login, and Manager modules together to verify seamless data flow.  
- Collaborate with Yeshey to integrate all modules and prepare for system testing.

## Conclusion
Month 2 marked a major milestone in my internship journey as we transitioned from design to real system implementation. Despite facing challenges like reduced manpower and technical difficulties, I gained significant hands-on experience in full-stack development using modern technologies. The process strengthened my understanding of how real-world applications are built and deepened my confidence in problem-solving and teamwork. Next month, I look forward to developing the Manager Dashboard and further enhancing the system’s functionality.
